# dln2-libusb
This is a userspace dln2 libusb libary to use https://github.com/notro/pico-usb-io-board without the need of a kernel module.

Also work on android using Termux. Thus this can de a easy way to the usb io ports to an android.

I was to lazy to kompile the kernel module for my host the rpi and the next kernel... and so on. Thus libusb is much more simple.
